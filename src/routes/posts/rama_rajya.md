Walking past the temple today, I witnessed bright saffron clothes adorning an otherwise dull-looking street. I saw men and women in bliss as they watched the consecration on a huge screen. It took me back to the days when my mother would tell me the tale of a man: a man who walked this land in search of his loved one. A man who brought together an army in search of his loved one. A man who fought a battle to get his loved one back.

She would continue "People were filled with joy as he returned. The city was illuminated not just with lamps and decorations, but also with bliss in the air. It was not only the return of a prince and his princess but one of a man who was committed to not just his loved ones, but also to his duties as a ruler. It was the return of a great man who prioritised the welfare of his subjects over anything else. This was a man that everyone looked up to. A "_Purushothama_" in the true sense of the word."

These are stories that shaped me into the person I am today. The question of "Is this a mystical tale or a reality?" is no longer one that holds meaning to me. The bliss that I experienced today on the street is one that I can never explain. I felt like a subject of the "_Rama Rajya_" rejoicing the return of a leader I always looked up to as a child. 

This is not going to be a legal or a political article where I make my case for why today should have been no different, but instead, an effort to explain how it feels to come out of 500 years of colonial encroachment over a site so dear to me and my faith. 

It is about time that we accept the fact that tensions between communities exist in this nation not because of some elected government, but because we never acknowledged the truth and reconciled with it. The political "left" sharing pictures of the Preamble of the Indian Constitution made me ask the question: "Do we not hold any identity as a nation but for our constitution?". 

Now it is for you to ask: Is it possible for a religious society such as Bharat’s which has historically embodied the spirit of Dharma regardless of method of religious practice, to turn into a "secular" state where the state has absolutely nothing to do with religion?. Secularism is a western concept that doesn't understand or belong in this land. We have learnt to live in peace much before western civilisation even came into existence, so Dharma has worked perfectly fine. The first mosque in India was established in India without any rebellion within a century of the Prophet’s death. Dharma has never had an issue with other faiths. The only issue it had was with coloniality: Islamic and British coloniality which both contributed to the partial demolition of India as a cultural entity. 

This land is the origin of faith systems with diametrically opposite views and practices. Hinduism in itself has multiple "_padhatis_" of worship which vary from deity to deity. Buddhism doesn't even believe in god and Jainism doesn't even take the definition of a “god” to be a creator. Regardless of the spectra of views and thoughts, all these faith systems find a place in the larger umbrella of "_dharma_".  The word "Dharma" loosely translates to rights and duty. _Dharma_ has always existed in this land regardless of the existence of a constitution. _Dharma_ has been the reason why this land has welcomed faith systems such as Islam, and Christianity and has also protected faith systems like Judaism and Zoroastrianism which are minorities in the true sense of the word. 

It is for you to understand that we are much more than some values jotted down 70-ish years ago in a constitution. There is no need to shy away from dharma calling it some "_sanghi_" thing. Having had a 75-year-long experience with this constitution, it is time to introspect if it truly continues to live in the spirit of this land. The spirit of this land has little to do with one particular faith system. The spirit of this land lies in its practices that predate much of the “modern” world. While most of the world has been shrouded with coloniality with Islamic or European conquests, this land has retained its identity through all of its rather violent history. It is for this generation to protect this identity regardless of their faith system and hence learn to distinguish "who you are" from "what you practice".

Having read all this, it is time to introspect for yourself: Do you want to be identified or defined by your constitution, or the great history of your land and the precedent that _dharma_ has set for centuries to come?
