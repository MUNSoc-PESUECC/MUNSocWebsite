It's time for the First Edition of MUNSOC Newsletter, and this time we're taking a closer look at the Union Budget 2023. The Finance Minister, NirmalaSitharaman , presented the budget on 1st Feb 2023, and there are several key highlights that we think are worth sharing with you. The union budget is the most important political statement that a government makes on the economy of a country and it sets the theme for the central direction of the country ºs growth. The 2023 Union Budget is rather significant since it is the last full budget of the second Modi government and sets the theme for the 2024 Lok Sabha Elections. The 2023 Union Budget presented by India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman focuses on seven key areas : inclusive development, reaching thelast mile, infrastructure and investment, unleashing potential, green growth, youth power, and the financial sector. The Indian government's revenue in 2023-24 comes mainly from taxes (58 paise in every rupee) and borrowings (34 paise in every rupee). The largest expenses are interest payments (20 paise in every rupee) and the states' share of taxes and duties (18 paise in every rupee).

### OPINION:

![image-010.png](https://i.postimg.cc/85Jc138g/image-010.png)

The opposition parties and Chief Ministers of non-BJP-ruled states have criticised the Union Budget 2023 presented by the Modi government. The Budget has been criticized as "anti-poor" and offering no solution to address thecountry's economic concerns such as unemployment, rising inflation, and growing inequality between the rich and poor. Mamata

Banerjee, Chief Minister of West Bengal, has referred to the budget as "dark" and prepared with an eye on the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. P Chidambaram,a former finance minister and a Congress leader, has criticised the budget for not addressing the concerns of the people and failing to mention the words "unemployment," "poverty," "inequality," or "equity" in the finance minister's speech. Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has referred to the budget as "nirmam" (empty) and lacking provisions for various sections of society. The Congress party has also criticised the budget for not addressing the real issues of the country such as unemployment and price rise and for having nothing to offer for the poor people of the country.

I understand the concerns about the budget and its impact on the Indian people. It's true that the allocation for essential social spending programs like MNREGA, food subsidy, and public health insurance has been reduced, which can have a negative impact on those who rely on these programs for basic necessities. Similarly, the lack of investment in education and healthcare during the pandemic can have long-term consequences for the future of the country and its citizens.

The reduction of the tax surcharge rate on incomeabove Rs 5 crore might seem like a scheme to appease the HNIs but the reason behind the reduction of the tax surcharge rate on income above Rs 5 crore is to increase compliance and generate better revenue for the government. The government hopes that by reducing the tax rate for high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), more wealthy households and individuals will disclose their income, which will lead to better compliance and lower tax evasion and unethical use of tax havens.

The government was concerned about the rising number of citizens giving up Indian citizenship, with estimates suggesting that over 8,000 HNIs could move out of India in 2022. By reducing the tax rate, the government hopes to stop the  ªRichieRich º exodus and encourage wealthy individuals to stay and invest in the country and contribute to the economy.

However, it's important to consider the overall context and challenges that the government is facing, such as the economic impact of the pandemic and the need to revive growth and create employment opportunities. The emphasis on infrastructure investment and production-linked incentive schemes can have a positive impact on the economy and job creation, which could eventually benefit a larger segment of the population.

It's also worth noting that the government has taken steps to simplify the tax regime and provide relief to the middle class through adjustmentsin the tax slabs and the reduction of the maximum marginal tax rate. These measures are expected to encourage consumption and provide a boost to the economy.

In summary, while the budget has its pros and cons, it's important to keep in mind the bigger picture and the government's goal of reviving the economy and creating job opportunities. At the same time, it's crucial for the government to ensure that its policies are equitable and address the basic needs and well-being of the Indian people.
