# Who is a refugee?

The UNHCR defines a refugee as a person who flees their home country due to violence, conflict, or persecution. With millions of people fleeing conflict, persecution, and environmental disasters, the need for compassionate and sustainable solutions has never been more urgent.

The refugee crisis is a complex issue that affects millions of people around the world. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are currently over 82 million forcibly displaced people, including refugees, asylum seekers, and internally displaced persons. This staggering number represents a humanitarian challenge that demands our attention and action.

The reasons behind the refugee crisis are varied, ranging from armed conflicts and political instability to human rights abuses, ethnic tensions, and environmental disasters. In Syria, for example, the ongoing civil war has displaced over 13 million people, with millions seeking refuge in neighbouring countries or attempting treacherous journeys to Europe. In South Sudan, the world's youngest nation, over 2.2 million people have been displaced due to violent conflict and food insecurity. While in Central America, widespread violence, poverty, and lack of economic opportunities have driven thousands to flee their homes in search of safety and a better life.

The military of Myanmar took over control of the country in a coup in February 2021. Many people were forced to flee the country while a large part of the population became displaced within its borders.

# Descendants of refugees retain refugee status

Under international law of family unity, the children of refugees and their descendants are also considered refugees until a durable solution is found. Both UNRWA and UNHCR recognize descendants as refugees on this basis, a practice that has been widely accepted by the international community, including both donors and refugee-hosting countries.

Behind the statistics and headlines, there are real people who have been forced to leave their homes and face unimaginable hardships. These include vulnerable women, children, and elderly people who often bear the burden of the crisis. Many refugees experience trauma, loss, and discrimination, and struggle to access basic necessities such as food, clean water, shelter, and healthcare. Children are often deprived of education, exposing them to further risks such as child labour, exploitation, and trafficking.

Yet, despite the challenges they face, refugees demonstrate resilience, strength, and courage in the face of adversity. They contribute to their host communities, economies, and societies in various ways, and many are eager to rebuild their lives and make positive contributions to their new homes.

The international community has responded to the refugee crisis with various approaches, ranging from humanitarian assistance and protection to resettlement. Humanitarian organizations have aided through various means, such as emergency shelter, food, water, and medical care, to refugees in dire need. However, funding shortage and inaccessibility, often hinder the effectiveness of these efforts.

Resettlement programs, which allow refugees to permanently settle in third world countries, have been a lifeline for some, but they are limited in their capacity to address the growing needs of the displaced population. Joining with the host countries also presents challenges, as refugees may face language barriers, discrimination, and difficulties in finding employment and affordable housing. Additionally, the issue of irregular migration and human trafficking remains a grave concern, with refugees often resorting to dangerous routes and falling prey to exploitation and abuse.
