					9. UniCon 2024 mandates each delegation to have at least one delegate in each committee,
					including IPC (International Press Corps). Failure to comply with this rule will result in
					non-acceptance of the registration, and a refund will not be processed. Please carefully
					consider this requirement and ensure that your delegation meets the committee
					representation criteria before proceeding with the registration process.
				</h4>
				<h4>10. Paste the link in the space provided on the Razorpay page.</h4>
				<h4>
					11. Sum up the total number of delegates for whom you've filled in the details on the
					sheet. Enter this count as the number of delegates you are paying for.
				</h4>
				<h4>12. Click "Pay" and proceed to the payment.</h4>
				<h4>
					13. After the payment is successful, you will receive a confirmation email from Razorpay.
				</h4>

					By following these steps, your delegation will successfully register for UniCon 2024. If
					you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to <a
